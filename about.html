    <div class = 'box'> This website is a booksearcher that allows you to look for books, and look at the different versions of the 
        cover art the book might have. Often times, books have different artwork, and different language versions, 
        and if you are a fan of a book, or might be looking for some artistic inspiration, looking at different variations
        of the same book cover can be a good source. It can also show you different editions of the same book, or book series. 
        For example, there could be a collected edition of a book series, or a box set, or maybe an audio CD. Using this website,
        itll easily show you all of the options using the image carousel on the right, and it will also show you valuable information
        about the book.
