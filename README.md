My project was designed to create an easy and convenient way for you to look up different versions of a book. For example, there might be a japanese, or french edition 
of a book you might be a fan of, and the different versions might have different features, or artwork. This gives you a way to see all the different version of a book
you might be interested in researching all in one convenient place.
